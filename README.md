# Daily Byte!

This was a [daily newsletter](https://thedailybyte.dev/) I found somewhere on the internet. Every day I get sent 0-2hr long exercises to do, with some questions from the "BIG" Companies!

## Om nom nom

In this repo will lie my personal list of solutions (starting December 19, 2020). Please feel free to shout at me about how bad my code is, or if you spot a glaring mistake in the complexities!!

@Shenia is my partner in crime for many of the solutions here, my thanks to her for proof-reading and guidance!
